to fold things...
knobs and buttons can fold inward on tracks pretty easily and maybe compress similar to russian dolls on tracks where a little bit fits
inside the lower fits inside the lower bit etc. 
you'll have to really think about it, but things can store in small areas if they are on tracks, on hinges that allow them to flip up, 
or on a motorized track that looks like a spiral staircase, but moves up and down so that you can form water and airtight bonds with it
you can also rotate things from being horizontal to the ground to being not horizontal compared to the ground. 

you can combine that all into the same area and make shit really fold, like wings if every inch fliped, folded, rotated and changed angles
then, win because epic amounts of smallness can be achieved like that. same with electrical components and motors.
