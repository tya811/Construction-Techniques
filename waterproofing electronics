pretty simple to waterproof any circuit really. don't use the surface layer of the pcb to print the metallic ink, put it 2 layers in at least
then do a rubber or cork layer on the outside of the top and bottom most layers of metallic ink, and if there is only one layer, print 
in black or something ink, the path that electricity follows, with demarcations of components and junctions etcetera. 

in order to be waterproofed, you have to move away from soldering.

So the solution is magnets coated in rubber with contact points wherever they need to be and then the base of all of the electronic components
needs to be magnetic so that it simply locks into place. 

and then maybe magnetic caps to waterproof the thing completely, but that should work..that should make a completely wateproof PCB that's still
easy to follow. 

just have to coat everything in rubber or cork or both in laminate layers.
