well, the plane and car hulls shoudl be designed for hydrodynamic and aerodynamic efficiency, simply making the front of a car look a 
little more like a boat, and then putting what look like small catamaran looking hulls in the rear of the car as a part of the car will do the trick
on land you need a spoiler at high speeds, but with this configuration, and with 2 or 3 jet ski engines on the back of the car, the cars can easily transition
into boats. 

and the tires on the car, there shoudl be a a row of 10 smallish tires on each side of the vehicle, with 2 or 3 tires on the outside of the 
catamaran looking hull parts, and what amounts to snowmobile equipment in the back (deployable)

now, after this, there will be no reason to salt roads, build bridges, or do anything, you can even make the cars optinally able to clear 
roads and plow snow.

and no matter what the weather conditions are, the cars will simply work and work well. 

you just have to make everything deplyable.
