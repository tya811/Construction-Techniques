Don't use screws


instead use magnets, dowelling rods, velcro, and that magnetic tape kinda stuff. 
make building and repairing things very easy, especially the internals of engines, instead of having to take a part the whole engine
be able to remove areas to get directly to what you need to do, and if you use magnets, then it's super easy to take of filters and intakes
and carbeurators and shit like that to get more access. 
use magnets in gearing, you can get more torque out of a system than you put in by simply using magnets. 
implment vertical takeoff and landing for all planes and rc planes, and put built in cameras and infrared and night vision cameras...
so people can fly their planes from in their homes without the risk of crashing. 

in wings, fins and surfboards and planes, you can use dowelling rods with rubber spacers every few cm, springs with kind of flat metal pieces
that contact the dowelling rods from the side every few inches or so and servo motors to create wings, fins and surfboard parts that are
interchangeable, and customizeable on an inflight or flight by flight basis. 

combustion chambers should be oddly shaped and have small funnels to accellerate air masses and create more expansive forces within the chamber

planes should always be wide and flat bodied, built of wood, metal, and rubber, and the wings should always be on the top and be curved,
dimpled, wingleted, and for supersonic flight, the front of the wings and intakes on planes should be pointy, but the tips of the pointy
areas should have somewhat large like a caldera on a volcano looking thing where there is a hole that air can get into and pool and flow
out unevenly on the sides, but only at the front
this should minimize the chances of a sonic boom ever happening. 

fans and rotor blades should be unevenly placed from front to back on their mounts, curved, dimppled, ridged, and wingleted to minimze
drag

there should be fanless intakes on the sides of jet engines for a lot of reasons, and they should feed air just behind the combustion chamber to achieve
more bypass and more torque, and the outflow of a jet should be changeable in shape and have compression and decompression to achieve higher
thrust.
